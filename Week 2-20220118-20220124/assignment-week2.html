<h4>MSDS - Week 2 Assignment</h4>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li>With the churn_data.csv dataset, I filtered outliers (even though there were none!). </li>
<li>I converted all categorial data columns to numerical besides the Customer ID column, which I thought was appropriate to keep the same. </li>
<li>I combined data columns by creating a MonthlyCharges / TotalCharges ratio data column.</li>
<li>I created a histogram of the created column and exported the entire dataset to csv.</li>
</ul>
