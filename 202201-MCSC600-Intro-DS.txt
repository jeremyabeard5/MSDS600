	Week 1 Presentation
		
		People / Directory of Names
		Much time is spent just cleaning data
		Big Data
			Volume(size), Variety(type), Velocity(how fast updated)
		DS Process
			Ask, Get, Explore, Model, Communicate
		Most Popular Languages
			Python, SQL, R
	Week 1 Reading
		Python Data Science Essentials,
			Sections:
				First Steps (“First Steps” through “Alternatives to Jupyter”)
				Strengthen Your Python Foundations (“Strengthen your Python Foundations” through “Don’t be shy, take a real challenge”)
		Python for Data Science for Dummies
			Sections:
				Ch. 1 and 2
		Python Data Science Essentials
			First Steps
				Data Science is:
					linear algebra, 
					statistical modeling, 
					visualization, 
					computational linguistics, 
					graph analysis, 
					machine learning, 
					business intelligence, 
					and data storage and retrieval.
				Python is awesome, basically
				The rest of First Steps was just setup, installing everything on Windows
				Getting jupyter setup
		PfDSfD
			Ch 1
				Data Science is:
					Data Capture
					Data Analysis
					Presentation
				
		



20220121 Friday
	Week 2 
		Even if data sets are different, processing is the same
			Data Acquisition
			Data Extraction
			Data Preprocessing
			Data Analysis
			Data Presentation
		Most data scientists spend 75-90% time cleaning data
		Data Preparation, Part Of :
			Business understanding
			Data understanding
				EDA, visualization
			Data Preparation
			Modeling
			Evaluation
			Deployment
		FINDING Outlier Boundary
			Upper Boundary = Q3 + 1.5*IQR
			Lower = Q1 - 1.5*IQR
		Dealing With Outliers
	Week 2 Reading
		Data Science With Python, Chapter 1
			Introduction
				Data is all around us
				Machine Learning: computers accomplishing tasks without human intervention using statistics and pattern recognition
			Python Libraries: pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn
				Pandas: open-sources, loading/processing data, analysing/manipulating data, csv is popular
				Numpy: Main python data science package, used with scientific computing and working on mathematical operations, working with arrays
				Matplotlib: data visualization package, uses numpy, 2d visualization
				Seaborn: data visualization based on matplotlib, more attractive graphics
				scikit-learn: Python package for machine learning
			Building Machine Learning Models
				Data Pre-processing
					cleaning
					most important step
				Model Learning
					models: using methods to find patterns and make prediction. algorithms can be supervised, semisupervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
				Model Evaluation
					using performance metrics, models are tuned
				Prediction
					after happy with evaluation, start prediction, helping decision makers
				Model Deployment
					some report, model, management, maintenance
				******this chapter focuses on pre-processing***
			Data Representation
				csv
				pandas loads data into dataframes
				DataFrame variables can be classified in 2 categories: independent variables and dependent(target) variables
				Single Data: Scalar
				Group of Scalars: Vector
				Group of Vectors: Matrix
			Data Categories
				Numerical vs. Categorical
					Numerical: ###'s
					Categorial: string or non-numerical
				Discrete vs. Continuous
					Discrete: ints
					Continuous: floats
				Ordered vs. Nominal
					Nominal: not ordered
			Then a bunch of Jupyter notebook stuff - DataSciencewithPython-Chapter1.ipynb
		Python for Data Science for Dummies, Chapter 5
			Understanding the Tools
				Learning anaconda/ipython help
				Learned how to change from 'Code' to 'Markdown' in Jupyter
