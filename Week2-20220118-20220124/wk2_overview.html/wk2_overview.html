<h1>Week 2: Cleaning and Preparing Data</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This week starts by describing different types of data, including qualitative and different types of quantitative data.&nbsp; Characteristics of data describe its organization or attributes, such as time-series data or the dimensionality of the data.&nbsp; Although the specific data processing details will differ depending on the type of data and its characteristics, the processing steps will be much the same &ndash; data acquisition, data extraction, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data presentation - essentially the data science process we talked about last week.</p>
<p>We will also learn about data preparation and cleaning. This is an important step in a data science process, especially if we are using machine learning. The way we clean, preprocess, and feature engineer data has a significant impact on the final results of analysis or machine learning systems. It's often said that data scientists spend most of their time cleaning and preparing data (anywhere from 75-90%), so it is an important skill to learn and master.</p>
