    "Take our social media we collected last week and:\n",
    "\n",
    "- extract the sentiment scores of the titles of the posts\n",
    "    - you can use the keyword method, Python packages, or other methods to extract the sentiment scores\n",
    "- plot a histogram of the sentiment scores\n",
    "- look at descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) of the sentiment scores\n",
    "- examine the text for some of the highest and lowest sentiment scores\n",
    "- write a short analysis of the results and our process, as well as propose one idea for something we could use this data for\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional advanced challenges:\n",
    "- Compare different sentiment analysis methods (e.g. textblob and VADER). Does one seem to work better than another?\n",
    "- Get the sentiments of the comments for each post. We can do a lot with this, such as:\n",
    "    - look at the average sentiment for each post and compare it with the sentiment of the title and/or text\n",
    "    - look at the distribution of sentiments for each post and find the posts with the widest range of sentiments (controversial posts)\n",
    "- Examine the subjectivity of our data (e.g. using textblob)\n",
    "- Use topic modeling on the posts\n",
    "    - you can also add in the comments to the topic model\n",
    "- Look at the most frequent words for positive and negative sentiment posts\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There is no assignment solution file for this week."
