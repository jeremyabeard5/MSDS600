	Week 3: Machine Learning
		FTE PDF - Week 3
			ML combines math, statistics, and algorithms with computer programming to enable computers to automatically learn patterns from data
			AI/ML used interchangeably sometimes
			Simpler Algorithms
				Logistic Regression
			More Advanced Algorithms
				lightGBMs
				Neural Network methods
			Algorithms - 3 GROUPS
				Supervised learning
					Learned is trained with known outputs (targets) or labeled examples.
					Labeled examples employed during the training process.
					In testing process, only unlabeled data are used.
					Supervised Learning Examples
						artificial neural networks
						decision trees
						Naive Bayes
						Bayesian believe network
						logistic regression
				Unsupervised learning
					Learner is trained with no label data. Therefore, learner must try to find some hidden structures in the data. 
					Input data are clustered into classes based on their feature properties.
					Unsupervised Learning Examples
						Self-organizing maps (SOM)
						K-means
				Reinforcement learning
					Learner learns by interaction with the environment.
					Input is fed to learner, then action/response is determined. THEN, learner adjusts its behavior from feedback.
					Over time, best performance is achieved by trial and error.
					Reinforcement Learning Examples
						Robot control systems
						Q-learning
			ML closely related with Data Mining
				Data mining is more focused on searching for patterns and relationships in a database.
				Data mining employs techniques from ML, Pattern recognition, statistics
				Data mining is crucial part of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)
					Other parts of KDD:
						Data preparation
						Data selection
						Data cleaning
				Goals of Data Mining
					Predictive Modeling: classification, regression, time series analysis
					Descriptive Modeling: clustering, summarization, association rules
				General Tasks of Data Mining
					Classification
						Maps input data into one of predefined classes. Example: mapping loan/no-loan to clients
						Learning Process: training phase, then testing phase
							Training Phase:
								Build models with generalization capability
									Generalization: ability to accurately predict the class labels that have never before seen during the training phase
							Testing Phase:
								Used to measure performance of the model (# predicted correctly/incorrectly)
							Inputs: 2 *non-overlapped* datasets:
								Training set
									Label examples
								Testing set
									No-label examples
								Not uncommon to also have *Validation set: examples used to adjust the architectures and error estimation of the model
						Classification Techniques:
							Decision Trees
							Rule-base Classifier
							Naive Bayes
							Supper Vector Machine
							Neural Networks
					Regression
						Function that maps a data item to a real-valued prediction.
						Used to estimate probability of survival patients based on diagnosis tests, predict customer default based on income, predict revenue from advertisement cost
					Clustering
						Clustering: example of descriptive modeling
						Set of clusters is identified as the result of data description
						Objects in the same group are similar in the group but different from objects in other groups
						Inputs are grouped according to similarity metrics such as Euclidean distance, Jaccard similarity, Tanimoto coefficient, and cosine similarity on data objects
						One of the most often used techniques is K-means
					Summarization
						Summarization: General overview of the data, usually dealing with aggregation information in various ways
						Different abstraction levels, different angles, different combinations
					Association Analysis
						AA: signifies co-occurence of items
						Focus: extracting interesting patterns that underly the associated features in data
						The relationships discovered can be formulated as association rules
						Applications consist of market basket analysis (items that customers buy together), genes that co-exist with particular diseases, etc
					Anomaly Detection
						AD: To pinpoint data points that behave significantly different from other data points. Called anomalies or outliers
						Ideally, anomaly detection algo's should have high detection rates but low false alarm rates
						Applications include credit card fraud, network intrusion, rare disease pattern
				Common Data Mining Methodologies
					Decision Trees
						Used for predictive modeling in classification and regression
						Model is easily understood and interpreted
						Decision tree algo's include ID3, C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993), and CART.
						Objective of DT is to predict the accurate class attribute from the non-class attributes. 
						Tree structure depends on chosen features and threshold
						DT is built recursively
							Training records (attribute/value pairs) are partitioned into subsets
							Partitioning stops when records have the same class labels, same attribute values, number of records fall below minimum threshold, or max. depth is reached
							Selecting the best split relies on the degree of impurity, the smaller the better
							A node with (0,1) class distribution has impurity 0 whereas node with (0.5,0.5) uniform distro has the highest impurity
							Here, we want the node to be pure or one class dominates
							Impurity Measures: Entropy and Gini index
							Attribute with the highest information gain will be selected.
							In ID3, information gain can be calculated from finding the difference between the values of impurity measure (i.e. entropy) before split and after
							For example
								Gain(X,T) = Info(T) - Info(X,T)
							In C4.5, gain ratio is utilized
								GainRatio(X,T) = Gain(X,T) / SplitInfo(X,T)
						DT should be pruned to avoid overfitting (certain depth of subtree below would be cut off)
							Overfitting happens when model does not generalize well or gives less accuracy in a new data set.
					Bayes Theorem (simple form)
						P(Y|X) = ( P(X|Y) P(Y) ) / P(X)
							X: attribute set
							Y: class variable
							P(Y): prior probability or Y
							P(X): prior probability of training data X (evidence)
							P(Y|X): probability of Y given X (Y after X is observed) (posterior probability for Y)
							P(X|Y): probability of X given Y (X after Y is observed) (class conditional probability)
							Conditional probability can be represented as:
								P(X|Y=y) = Product(i=1:d) P(Xi|Y=y)
									Attribute set X consists of d attributes {X1, X2, X3, ..., Xd}
									P(X) is fixed for every Y
									Therefore, posterior probability can be formulated as:
										P(Y|X) = [ P(Y) Product(i=1:d) P(Xi|Y=y) ] / P(X)
					Bayesian Believe Network (BBN)
						BBN: Graphical model that represents probabilistic relationships among random variables
						Contrary to Naive Bayes where all attributes from class conditional probability P(X|Y) are assumed conditionally independent,
							Bayesian network approach can specify which attribute pairs are conditionally independent
						Important components of Bayesian network include:
							1. The dependence relationships in a set of variables are presented with a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
							2. Each node has its own probability table that associated with its immediate parent nodes
						BBN can be applied in medicine, bioinformatics, and decision support systems
					Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
						ANN: inspired by biological neurons
						Many inputs and one output unit
						Output can be excited (fired) or not excited (not fired)
						ANN consists of many nodes (computing units)
						Weights: connections between nodes, which encode with the learning information
						Node receives input from the external source or other nodes
						Each input is associated with the weight.
						Node computes the weighted sums of its inputs, including applying a function called activation functino to this result
						Output from computation can be served as input to other units
						There are many ANN architectures
							simple one called perceptron by Rosenblatt.
							Perceptron aka Single-Layer Perceptron: linear classifier that consists of only input layer (receive inputs from environ) and output layer (produce output back to environ)
							This is simplest feed-forward network
								FFN: network where nodes in one layer connected to the nodes in the next layer. 
									Network = Multilayer Neural Networks: consists of hidden layers (layers between input and outut nodes)
									Multilayers with at least one hidden layer are universal approximators. This means the networks can approximate any functions given that they have enough computation units.
						Most popular algorithm to train the network is back-propagation innovated by Rumelhart and McClelland
							Back-Prop adjusts weights based on activation functions such as sigmoid.
							Objective: reduce sum of squared error between the desired output (target) and the output calculated by the network.
							Back-Prop is example of supervised learning where the target is known
						Application of neural networks: stock market prediction, hand written / spoken words recognition, image compression, loan/CC approval, control systems
					K-means
						K-means: unsupervised learning
						Popular technique for grouping (clustering) objects because of its simplicity and speed
						Objective: partition n observation objects into K clusters so that distance between objects and cluter centroids are minimized.
						Centroid: mean of object cluster
						At beginning, cluster numbers (constant K) are specified). Algo will randomly choose the K objects as the initial centroids
						Then, these 2 steps are repeasted until centroids converge or do not change
							1. assign each object to one of K clusters based on its closet centroid
							2. re-compute the new centroid for each cluster
						Assigning objects to the appropriate clusters can be expressed using the similarity measure such as Euclidean distance, COsine, etc.
						Using right measures of closeness will have a great impact on the results
						Disadvantages of this algo include: results from each run may not be the same, and , # of clusters must be specified at the beginning

			Using CRISP-DM project management cycle
			Already did Business Understanding, Data Understading, and Data Preparation
				our example (diabetes/no diabetes), assignment (churn/no churn)
			This week: Modeling/Deployment
			Machine Learning: CPU algo's that learn patterns
				supervised
				unsupervised
				reinforcement
				can also have semi-supervised
			ML uses math and statistics
			We will cover supervised this week
			Supervised
				Features (inputs) and targets (outputs, labels)
				Classification
					Binary: 0 and 1, such as diabetes / no diabetes
					Multi-class: any # (dog breeds)
					Multi-label: multi-class, but each datapoint can have multiple classes (topics for news articles)
				Simple algos: logistic and linear regression
				More complex: decision trees, random forests, boosting algos
			Unsupervised
				No labels
				Mostly clustering algorithms, K-means, etc
				Clustering: grouping un=labeled data into groups
			Reinforcement
				System learns from positive/negative rewards in environment
				This is difficult, but exciting
				OpenAI, Google's Deep Mind
			Important about ML: Bias-Variance Trade-Off
				Linear fit vs. Polynomial fit
				Judging overfitting (too complex) (high variance): low error but model can't predict new data
				Opposite site: high bias (large error) on all data points. Leads to high error also
				Can train model for more high bias or more high variance
			To check for high bias/variance: split data into Training and Testing sets. (testing=validation)
				Majority of data will be Train, minority will be Test
				If Train accuracy is much higher than Test, then that's a sign of overfitting
			We'll mainly stick to simple model for binary classif.: Logistic Regression
				Easy to use
				Pretty fast
				X: dataset, features
				P(X): probability (of diabetes)
				Log(p/(1-p)) is the logit, or log-odds
				Linearly related to coefficients (betas, B1, B2, etc)
				Logit with a single feature is the sigmoid curve
					Assumes linear relationships between log odds and features
					Independent samples (each datapoint doesn't affect others)
			Python packages
				scikit-learn (sklearn) and related scikit packages (eg scikit-optimize and many more)
				h20
				pyspark (for big data)
				statsmodels (more classic stats methods)
				Neural Network Libraries (tensorflow/keras, pytorth, etc.)
				autoML: pycaret, TPOT, etc
				More
				We will use sklearn this week
		VIDEO 2: FTE Video
			In FTE assignment
				First step: loading packages
				Then Modeling (step 4)
					We need features and targets for supervised learning
					Targets: 0/1 values related to diabetes
					We want to split data into Train and Test sets
						using scikitleaern train_test_split function
							stratify argument: tells function we should keep proportion of classes and targets the same between Test and Train sets
							outputs X_train and X_test (features for Train/Test) and Y_train and Y_test (targets for Train/Test)
					Then we increase iterations to 1000
				Then Evaluation (step 4)
					Easiest metric: accuracy (# correct / total samples), compared to 'no information rate'
					NIR: simple approx is just to look at the proportion of different classes (84.6% of data is no-diabetes, so we can just predict 0 for all, and get 84.6% accuracy)
					use the score model, give it features and targets
					another way to evaluate: confusion matrix
						scikitlearn has plot_confusion_matrix
						takes model, features, targets, and outputs true positives/negatives and predicted positives/negatives. shows you false negatives and false positives
						We prolly wanna worry about true positives (maximize) and minimize false negatives (telling someone they don't have diabetes when they actually do)
							We can maximize True Positive Rate (true poz / (true poz + false neg) )
							All scikitlearn functions have a proba function : changing threshold for rounding these predictions
							proba: predicts probabilities for classes and classification
								give it features, outputs probabilities
								can select first column and choose our threshold, see how it affects the True Positive Rate
					can also look at accuracy score before and after we changed the threshold, can look at true positive rate before and after changing
						lower accuracy but higher true positive rate (***tradeoffs***)
					Last thing: we can look at the coefficients (betas B1 B2 etc in logit equation from slideshow)
						lr_model.coef can show us coefficients, then we get columns, match them up to a dataframe, plot em
				Then Deployment:
					Automate using API
					Can integrate model into software system
				CORRECTION
					changing "brief summary writeup" section , 91% accur on TEST data, not training

20220206 Sunday
	Week 4: Decision Trees (Tree-based ML and Feature Selection
		FTE PDF - Week 4
			Decision Trees: split data into groups automatically based on features which give the best split between classes
				Try different features and different splits, then calculate purity of splitting categories (Gini impurity or entropy)
				Majority class in each leaf is the prediction
				Data does not need to be scaled (unlike distance-based algos like KNN and other algos like neural networks)
				Prone to overfitting (high variance)
			Gini criterion = Gini impurity = Gini index
				Gini = 1 - SUM(p^2)
			Entropy
				Slightly more complex than Gini
				Minimum (best) is 0, when the samples in a leaf node are all one class
				Entropy = -1 * SUM(p_j * log_2 * p_j)
			Regression 
				Most ML algorithms in sklearn have a regression component
					Example: DecisionTreeClassifier has DecisionTreeRegressor
				Uses different criterion than what we've seen so far 
				Instead of Gini or Entropy, these use things like MSE (mean squared error)
					MSE: takes difference between each prediction and actual, squares it, then sums it
				Counterpart to logistic regression = linear regression
			Random Forests
				Random Forests: takes many decision trees and average their predictions to get final prediction
				Sample datapoint from entire dataset, enough times that we have same # in sample as original
				BOTH a classifier and a regressor random forest class in sklearn
				Do that for a specific number of trees
			Feature Importances
				Curse of Dimensionality: as we add more features, we need exponentially increasing numbers of datapoints
					Solution: collect more data or remove some features
					Too many features = poor performance of ML algorithms (overfitting or underfitting)
				Picking the best features
					Univariate statistics (correlation, mutual information score, chi2 score, etc)
					Forward and backward selection with ML algos: add/subtract features until we have good performance and minimal features
					Recursive: same as forward/backward but trying all features
					Feature importance methods: rank features based on importance (Gini or entropy gain for trees)
			Pearson Correlation
				Measures linear relationship strength between two variables
				-1 to +1, with 0 being no correlation and -1 and +1 being perfect correlation
				Formula
					r = Sum((x_i - x_bar)(y_i - y_bar)) / Sqrt(SUM((x_i-x_bar)^2) * SUM((y_i-y_bar)^2))
			Phi-K Correlation
				Newer version of correlation
				Bins numeric groups into categories and uses chi-2 correlation
		Video Lectures - Week 3
			Review from last week
				Different Types of Machine Learning
					Supervised
					Unsupervised
					Reinforcement
					Semi-supervised
				Hi Bias vs. Hi Variance: Hi Bias=linear fit, high error, Hi Variance=too specific
				Logistic regression: simple model for binary classification
			This Week: decision trees as machine learning algo
			Decision Tree
				Goal: get all no-diabetes on one side and all diabetes on the other side
				Each node: value=diabetes vs. no-diabetes #'s, adds up to samples
				Prone to overfitting
			Gini Criterion
				"1 minus the sum of probility squared over all classes"
			Entropy
				Also called "information gain"
				Minimum: 0. That's best, when there's only one class in a node
			Regression
				MSE: mean squared error = SUM(differences^2)
			Random Forests: collection of decision trees
				Each decision tree is a bit different
				All DT's make their prediction
				Average all predictions (or combine in some way) to get final prediction
				Each split uses subset of the features (can be randomly chosen) to see which features give the best split
				Can set # of trees we want
				Random forests usually outperform decision trees
				Random forests are easy to parallelize
