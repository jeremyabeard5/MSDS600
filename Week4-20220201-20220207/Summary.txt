imported dataset clean_churn_data
targets: churn
features: all but churn and customer ID (categorical)
created train and test set (used default as 25% test size)
fit the training data to a decision tree classifier
	depth is 26, wayyyy too cluttered
	default accuracy
		train: 0.9936
		test: 0.7257
reduced the depth based on the depth value outputted by the for-loop which iterates thru depth
	optimal depth of decision tree was 4
	new accuracy:
		train: 0.7942
		test: 0.7842
plotted new decision tree with depth 4
plotted pearson correlation between all features and target
created randomforestclassifier
	used 2 for-loops to optimize max_depth and max_features (depth 7 and max features as default)
	New accuracy:
		train: 0.8241
		test: 0.7961
plotted the feature importance
dropped 'tenure', 'paymentmethod', and'phoneservice' from features as they had negative correlation
	New accuracy:
		train: 0.8097
		test: 0.7871
	re-computed optimal max depth and max features (6 and 2)
	re-plotted feature importance
